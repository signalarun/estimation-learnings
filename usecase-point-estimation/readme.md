# Usecase point estimation
[UCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Points) is used when the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Rational Unified Process (RUP) methodologies are being 
used for the software design and development. The concept of UCP is based on the requirements for the system being
written using use cases, which is part of the UML set of modeling techniques. 
The UCP technique was developed by Gustav Karner in 1993 while employed at what was known at the time as Objectory Systems, 
which later merged into Rational Software and then IBM. The UCP method was created to solve for estimating the software
size of systems that were object oriented. It is based on similar principles as the Function Point (FP) estimation method,
but was designed for the specific needs of object oriented systems and system requirements based on use cases.
