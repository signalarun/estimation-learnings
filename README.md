# Learnings on software project estimation
## [Usecase point estimation](https://github.com/signalarun/estimation-learnings/tree/master/usecase-point-estimation)

## Web projects
 1. Choosing the size  
     1.1 Use any software size measure, this can the standard used in your organization or that which is comfortable to you.
 2. Analyze each tier and estimate the size of the software to be developed at each tier.
 3. Determining the effort  
     3.1 Convert the estimated size into effort using any methods
 4. Estimating graphics assets  
     4.1 Estimate development of graphics assets using task-based estimation considering skill of graphics designer
 5. Overall effort  
     5.1 Sum all the derived efforts to get overall effort requirement for the project

## Effort from software size
 1. Productivity  
     Its the rate of achievement and can be expressed as person-hours per unit of software size or as software size per person-day
 2. Person-hours per unit of software size  
     eg. Effort =  100<size> * 10<person-hours or productivity>
                = 1000 person-hours    
 3. Units of software size per person-day  
      eg. Effort = 100<size> / 0.5<size per person-day or productivity>  
 4. Contingency allowance 10%
